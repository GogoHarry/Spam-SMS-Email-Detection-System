# SMS Spam Detection

## Project Overview
The proliferation of online platforms has led to an overwhelming volume of unsolicited messages, including promotional and fraudulent content, inundating consumer inboxes. This deluge of spam obscures essential communications, diminishing user experience.

## Project Objective
This project aims to develop a robust SMS spam detection model capable of accurately classifying messages as legitimate or spam. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Naive Bayes algorithm, we analyze a dataset of 5,574 SMS messages labeled as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam." This will contribute to the development of effective spam filtering solutions, enhancing user experience and mitigating the negative impacts of unsolicited messages.
